		<p>The aim of this website is to promote interest in Myanmar's amazing history.  </p>

		<p>Our hope is to challenge the often two-dimensional and uncritical views of history taught in Myanmar by reexamining key periods  in the country's past.  We would like as well to reveal the rich multicultural nature of Myanmar's history and its deep and ongoing ties to global events and trends.</p>

		<p>Finally, this website will also delve into the history of neighbouring regions, such as Yunnan in China and the Northeast in India, in the hope of introducing these places to a Myanmar audience.</p>

		<p>We believe that meeting Myanmar's many challenges today will require fresh imaginative thinking.  This is turn will only be possible with a clear and critical understanding of Myanmar and global history.</p>

		<p>This website is initially based on Thant Myint-U's Facebook page.  From 2012-208 he posted over 4,000 posts, the vast majority linked to Myanmar's history.  These are now being translated in Myanmar and will form the foundations of this website.  We hope by placing these posts, in Myanmar and on this website, they will be more accessible.</p>

		<p>The intention though is to grow this website, by including new posts, as well as through new and interactive ways of thinking of Myanmar history.</p>

		<p>This website is a project of U Thant House, a museum and leading discussion centre in Yangon, dedicated to the former UN Secretary-General and the issues he cared about the most, including peace, sustainable development, the environment, and human rights.</p>

		<p>For more information, please see: <a href="https://www.uthanthouse.org/">uthanthouse.org</a></p>

		<p>The development of this website was made possible by a generous grant from the Government of Denmark and the support of <a href="http://phandeeyar.org/">Phandeeyar</a>, Myanmar's leading technology hub.</p>
